> how to buy banani from beatrice

Banani is a library for the Banano cryptocurrency that will support sending, receiving, changing rep, RPC calls, message signing, wallet management, etc. It aims to be a more powerful and sensible version of @bananocoin/bananojs. Banani takes heavy inspiration from [bananopie](https://github.com/stjet/bananopie) (which I also wrote), which in turn takes some inspiration from my experiences with ethers.js.

The docs are hosted at https://banani.prussia.dev.

Currently being written, and heavy work in progress.
