> how to buy banani from beatrice

Banani is a library for the Banano cryptocurrency that will support sending, receiving, changing rep, RPC calls, message signing, wallet management, etc. It aims to be a more powerful and sensible version of @bananocoin/bananojs. Banani takes heavy inspiration from [bananopie](https://github.com/stjet/bananopie) (which I also wrote), which in turn takes some inspiration from my experiences with ethers.js.

The docs are hosted at https://banani.prussia.dev.

Currently being written, and heavy work in progress.

## Work Generation
Though Kalium's public work will generate work for you, it is suggested that you generate your own work for the following reasons:
- it is relatively "easy" (in terms of computation) to do
- if Boompow goes offline (as it has done in the past), many Banano services will go down, which is not great for users and is not a very decentralized or resilient way to make your thing
